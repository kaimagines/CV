        <p>I have always loved art; I’ve wanted to be an artist since I was child
          coloring next to the illustrations in my books.
          As I grew older, that love matured into my goals of a career in Graphic Design.
          During my time as a design student, and a freelance designer,
          I have developed a solid base in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator,
          and gained strong design and page layout skills, making posters, logos, icons, and tickets.
          I also have knowledge in HTML and CSS, InDesign, Powerpoint, and Microsoft Word.
          In my free time I enjoy trying new resturants, playing video games, wathcing movies,
          playing volleyball, and petting all the dogs.</p>
